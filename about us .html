                Every tourist who intends to visit the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia searches for the best destination in terms of culture, climate, activities and events. However, it is difficult to search for every region, and due to certain circumstances in the culture. Hence, there must be a website that collects most of the information about Arab culture. The Saudi Destination Website project is proposed to collect information about Saudi regions and display it to users. This website is designed to give an opportunity to the tourist in choosing their favorite destination. The Saudi Destination website has two main goals: Firstly, it helps the tourists to discover the richness of Saudi culture. Therefore, the Saudi Destination website is very useful to make it easier for them to choose a tourist destination easily. secondly, the website is to introduce female tourists to the appropriate time for the regions in terms of climate and events.
